Solution:
Every user will only see their own data on the dashboard, it will filter data based on the currently logged-in user.

This is my pycharm. How to see the schema of propertyhub.db in the terminal?
How to do something like SELECT * FROM users to view my data?

Solution
I have also added db_viewer1.py to view the database in terminal.

Another issue. this is not mobile responsive.

Solution
It is mobile-responsive . The tables, cards, and forms can properly adapt to smaller screen sizes. There is a class to hide less important columns on mobile (remark, date columns).

Optimized form controls for touch devices, the buttons are larger and more tappable.
Regarding Typography Adjustments, reduced font sizes on smaller screens, adjusted heading sizes for better readability

TS
[search & filter & sort by]
Now, please create sort by and search functionality for my tables.
The search functionality should enable partial searches.

TS
There is a bug. Actually it is not about partial search problem. The problem is that, when I first type "di" in the input field, then when I click "search", it doesnt respond at all. When I change it to "did", then it respond.

Solution
Create Sort By and Search functionality for the tables.
The search functionality should enable partial searches.
The search functionality have to properly handle short search terms like "di".
Made search real-time, the search will updates as the user type.

Now, your task, please create a dedicated admin area accessible only page for me as the programmer. Something like with direct url access to 127.0.0.1:5000/admin . This admin page can let me view all the databases. It also allow me to add and remove the users.
--------
When the application starts, it will automatically create an admin user with:

Email: admin@example.com
Password: admin123
You can then access the admin area at: http://127.0.0.1:5000/admin

A dedicated admin area accessible only page for me as the programmer was created. When the user access something like with direct url access to 127.0.0.1:5000/admin . This admin page can let tme as the programmer view all the databases. It also allow as the programmer to add and remove the users. 


Now, your task, is to Implement role-based access control for different companies with various user roles. For each company, there will be different roles which can have different access right to the page, example, manager can view all the pages. Cleaner can only view Complain Page. Technician can view Repair page and complain page.
How to do that?

Note: Have to delete .db everytime restart]
